merge: Apply the differences between two sources to a working copy path.
usage: 1. merge sourceURL1[@N] sourceURL2[@M] [WCPATH]
       2. merge sourceWCPATH1@N sourceWCPATH2@M [WCPATH]
       3. merge [-c M | -r N:M] SOURCE[@REV] [WCPATH]

  1. In the first form, the source URLs are specified at revisions
     N and M.  These are the two sources to be compared.  The revisions
     default to HEAD if omitted.

  2. In the second form, the URLs corresponding to the source working
     copy paths define the sources to be compared.  The revisions must
     be specified.

  3. In the third form, SOURCE can be a URL, or working copy item
     in which case the corresponding URL is used.  This URL in
     revision REV is compared as it existed between revisions N and 
     M.  If REV is not specified, HEAD is assumed.
     The '-c M' option is equivalent to '-r N:M' where N = M-1.
     Using '-c -M' does the reverse: '-r M:N' where N = M-1.

  WCPATH is the working copy path that will receive the changes.
  If WCPATH is omitted, a default value of '.' is assumed, unless
  the sources have identical basenames that match a file within '.':
  in which case, the differences will be applied to that file.

Valid options:
  -r [--revision] arg      : ARG (some commands also take ARG1:ARG2 range)
                             A revision argument can be one of:
                                NUMBER       revision number
                                '{' DATE '}' revision at start of the date
                                'HEAD'       latest in repository
                                'BASE'       base rev of item's working copy
                                'COMMITTED'  last commit at or before BASE
                                'PREV'       revision just before COMMITTED
  -c [--change] arg        : the change made by revision ARG (like -r ARG-1:ARG)
                             If ARG is negative this is like -r ARG:ARG-1
  -N [--non-recursive]     : operate on single directory only
  -q [--quiet]             : print as little as possible
  --force                  : force operation to run
  --dry-run                : try operation but make no changes
  --diff3-cmd arg          : use ARG as merge command
  -x [--extensions] arg    : Default: '-u'. When Subversion is invoking an
                             external diff program, ARG is simply passed along
                             to the program. But when Subversion is using its
                             default internal diff implementation, or when
                             Subversion is displaying blame annotations, ARG
                             could be any of the following:
                                -u (--unified):
                                   Output 3 lines of unified context.
                                -b (--ignore-space-change):
                                   Ignore changes in the amount of white space.
                                -w (--ignore-all-space):
                                   Ignore all white space.
                                --ignore-eol-style:
                                   Ignore changes in EOL style
  --ignore-ancestry        : ignore ancestry when calculating merges
  --username arg           : specify a username ARG
  --password arg           : specify a password ARG
  --no-auth-cache          : do not cache authentication tokens
  --non-interactive        : do no interactive prompting
  --config-dir arg         : read user configuration files from directory ARG
